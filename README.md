CDP enables rapid deployment of ad-hoc LoRa mesh networks when cellular or internet infrastructure fails, such as after hurricanes, earthquakes, or wildfires, allowing first responders and survivors to share location data, status updates, and requests via low-cost Duck nodes.


Explore real-world ClusterDuck Protocol deployments in disaster response, environmental monitoring, and more. This app showcases interactive scenario cards, detailed modal views, and data flow visualization.


Key Features
Interactive Scenario Cards: Browse deployments like Hurricane Maria, Himalayan Rescue, and Wildfire Tracking
Detailed Modal Views: View capabilities, tech stack, and implementation details
Data Flow Visualization: See how data moves through the mesh network to cloud or local storage
Category Filtering: Filter by Disaster Response, Environmental, Public Events, or Agriculture


Use Cases
Disaster Response: Hurricane Maria, Himalayan Earthquakes, Wildfire monitoring
Environmental: Smart agriculture, wildlife tracking
Public Events: Mass event congestion relief

Technical Flow
DuckLinks → MamaDucks → PapaDucks → Cloud/Local Storage


Design
Urgent, professional aesthetic with rose/red accents and slate/blue tech vibes
Clean card layout and responsive grid system
Visual indicators for tech stack and location data
